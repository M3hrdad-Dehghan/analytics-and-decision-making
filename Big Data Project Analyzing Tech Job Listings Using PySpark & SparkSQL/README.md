## 🧠 Business Problem

Understanding labor market trends requires analyzing large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured job listing data, which is not feasible with traditional analytics tools. 

---

## 🎯 Objective 

The objective of this project was to apply distributed big data processing to uncover insights about skill demand, job roles, salary trends, and geographic distribution across the technology job market.

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- Large-scale technology job listings dataset containing job titles, required skills, locations, and salary information
- Semi-structured and unstructured text fields extracted from job descriptions
- High-volume data processed in a distributed computing environment using Apache Spark

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- Used PySpark and SparkSQL to process and analyze millions of job listings through distributed data transformations and aggregations
- Built scalable data pipelines for data cleaning, normalization, filtering, and feature extraction from raw job posting data
- Applied SparkSQL queries to compute market-level metrics such as skill frequency, role demand, salary distributions, and regional trends
- Optimized transformations for performance and scalability to support efficient exploratory and analytical workloads
