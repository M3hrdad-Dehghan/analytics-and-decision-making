## 🧠 Business Problem

In many organizations, valuable insights are locked inside relational databases, but extracting them requires more than basic SQL queries. 

---

## 🎯 Objective 

The objective of this project was to apply advanced SQL techniques to solve real-world analytical problems, uncover patterns, and generate accurate, scalable, and decision-ready insights from complex datasets.

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- Relational datasets stored in SQL tables (fact and dimension-style schemas)
- Time-based records, categorical attributes, and numerical measures
- Business scenarios requiring historical comparison, ranking, segmentation, and trend analysis

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- Used advanced SQL constructs including:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular and readable query design
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD, moving aggregates) for time-based and group-level analysis
- Conditional aggregations and CASE logic for business rule implementation
- Subqueries and multi-level joins to solve complex analytical questions
- Focused on query optimization, balancing correctness, performance, and maintainability
- Designed queries to be reusable and scalable for large datasets and recurring analytical needs

---

## 🛠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Advanced SQL analytics and query design
- Window functions and analytical SQL patterns
- Data modeling awareness and join strategies
- Performance-aware query optimization
- Translating business questions into precise SQL logic
